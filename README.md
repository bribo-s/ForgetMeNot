This was my group's submission to the cmd-f 2024 hackathon! It is called ForgetMeNot (named after the flower). Its functions involve: setting up calendar events for doctor appointments and daily activities, keeping track of important healthcare contacts, and including information about dosage, time, and function. Overall, it is a mobile app which strives to ease and relieve the difficulties experienced by dementia patients.
